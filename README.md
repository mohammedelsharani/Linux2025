#Resetting iptables to accept all traffic
Setting default policies to ACCEPT for all chains:

iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT - Sets the default policy for the INPUT chain to ACCEPT

iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT - Sets the default policy for the OUTPUT chain to ACCEPT

iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT - Sets the default policy for the FORWARD chain to ACCEPT

Flushing (clearing) all rules from all tables:

iptables -t filter -F - Flushes all rules from the filter table (default table)

iptables -t nat -F - Flushes all rules from the nat table

iptables -t mangle -F - Flushes all rules from the mangle table

iptables -t raw -F - Flushes all rules from the raw table

This effectively opens up the firewall completely by:
Accepting all incoming, outgoing and forwarded traffic by default
Removing any existing firewall rules that might block or filter traffic

iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

This iptables command is very common in firewall configurations. Here's a simple and concise explanation:

iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
 What It Means:
-A INPUT: Append this rule to the INPUT chain, which handles incoming traffic.
-m state: Use the state module (for connection tracking).
--state ESTABLISHED,RELATED: Match packets that are part of an already established connection, or related to one.
-j ACCEPT: Allow (accept) the traffic.

 Simple Example:
 _______________________
Imagine you're downloading a file from a website:
Your computer sends a request out (this goes through the OUTPUT chain).
The server responds back (this comes in via INPUT).

This rule allows that response traffic in because it's part of an ESTABLISHED connection.

 Why It's Important:
 _____________________________-
Without this rule, even if your outgoing connections work, the responses from the other side might get blocked â€” breaking the communication.

In Short:
----------
This rule allows reply traffic and related traffic into your system, while still keeping the firewall secure.













Warning: This configuration leaves the system with no firewall protection. It should only be used for testing or troubleshooting purposes, not in production environments where security is important
