#Resetting iptables to accept all traffic
Setting default policies to ACCEPT for all chains:

iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT - Sets the default policy for the INPUT chain to ACCEPT

iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT - Sets the default policy for the OUTPUT chain to ACCEPT

iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT - Sets the default policy for the FORWARD chain to ACCEPT

Flushing (clearing) all rules from all tables:

iptables -t filter -F - Flushes all rules from the filter table (default table)

iptables -t nat -F - Flushes all rules from the nat table

iptables -t mangle -F - Flushes all rules from the mangle table

iptables -t raw -F - Flushes all rules from the raw table

This effectively opens up the firewall completely by:

Accepting all incoming, outgoing and forwarded traffic by default

Removing any existing firewall rules that might block or filter traffic

Warning: This configuration leaves the system with no firewall protection. It should only be used for testing or troubleshooting purposes, not in production environments where security is important
